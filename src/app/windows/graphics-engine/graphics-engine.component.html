        <p>I took on the challenge of building my own physics simulation engine from scratch. This means writing the shaders that tell the
            GPU what to render. Progressing each object forward in time, based on real life physics. Efficiently resolving
            collisions of objects and deciding the response. This has really tought me more about the C++ language and how computer graphics are done.

                    <p>This Simulation shows one object of a low mass colliding with larger object of larger mass
                        it can be seen that the object with the lower mass is often moving fastest as it has less inertia
