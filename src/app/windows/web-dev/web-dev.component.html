            javascript or how to serve a file
            In Hindsight it was'nt the best purchasing desicion for the skillset I had at the time. Since then i
            have
            learned store data on SQL/NoSQL dataabases.
            I have learned Transmittion Protocols, all in the effort to serve website Files and API's.</p>

            I'm not stuck in the past though, where there is no need for self-hosting a service, a cloud service will
            do.
            I have used Google Firebase to handle things such as user authentication and distributed messanging, and
            have used Cloudflare to cache static files so that content is served to the user faster

                            I then build an app that would alert me of such properties.

                            This project makes heavy use of Amazon Web Services. First the source code
                            is compiled to the build files, and these build files are sent to an s3 bucket.
                            The DNS is configured on Route 53 to fetch content from the Cloudfront CDN, which gets its content from the s3 bucket.
                            Using git hooks, I have automated the process of invalidating the cache once new content is uploaded to the s3 bucket.
